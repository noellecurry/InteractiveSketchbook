            <h1>My verb is quickly.</h1> 
            <h4>I thought honestly some parts of the reading were a little difficult 
                to understand but I did learned from the reading more about the draw() and setup (),
                specifically that variables should go outside of setup and draw so they could be
                 run globally. Also that code inside setup runs once but code inside draw is continuous.
                 The new thing I tried was in chapter 5 example 5-6 and it affects my sketch because mouse 
                 has an ellipse that drags along.</h4>
