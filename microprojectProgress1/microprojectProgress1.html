                Concept Summary
             </h1>

             <h3>
                The systems interaction will be a button that prompts the user to press and when pressed a flower will appear, 
                rotate, and then disappear. The user has control over whether they will press the button or not. If the button is 
                pressed then the systems interaction will occur or else the button is not pressed, nothing will change. When the 
                interaction happens and the button is pressed, the change over time happens when the flower appears still for 30 seconds, 
                then rotates for another 30 seconds, then will fade out and disappear for another 30 seconds. 
             </h3>

             <h1>
                Structural Growth
             </h1>

             <h3>
                This system will grow over the next three weeks because I will implement adding the rotation, disappearing, and making the flower shape. 
                I believe my biggest friction will be not only creating the flower shape but getting the flower to rotate on time-based decay as 
                I want to occur as well. The next growth stage I would like to happen is to add the time change to occur; I want to focus on all time changes
                of when it rotates and disappears. The last thing I would like to tackle on this micro project is the actual flower itself. 
             </h3>

             <h3>
                State 1: System shows button prompting users to press
                <br>
                State 2: System shows flower (for now circle) if button is pressed
             </h3>
