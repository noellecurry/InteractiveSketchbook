            <h1>Sketch #9</h1> 

            <h4>The interaction that was added was directional instructions prompting that if the user wants to navigate 
they can use the left and right arrow keys. Modularizing changed how I think about the 
system because it showed that instead of thinking of the system as whole it can break down the system output
to more managable parts of the whole. Sketch #9 communicates more clearly than sketch #8 because it tells user how
many states there are and how to navigate back and forth between those states. This system feels like a more controlled version
of system 8 because it is centered and it tells user that there are other photos to click through.
